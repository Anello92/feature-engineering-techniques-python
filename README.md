# **Feature Engineering Techniques with Python**

## Description

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on **Feature Engineering** techniques using Python. It demonstrates various strategies for transforming raw data into meaningful insights, essential for building efficient machine learning models. The project uses **pandas**, **numpy**, and **matplotlib** for data manipulation and visualization.

## Python Packages Used in the Project
- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**
- **watermark**
- **re** (Regular Expressions)

These packages are essential for handling data, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing results.

## Data Preprocessing

The project begins with loading and inspecting the dataset, followed by a series of preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning (e.g., removing invalid characters such as "?" in categorical data)
- Recategorizing variables for better analysis

## Feature Engineering Techniques

A key part of this project is applying **feature engineering** techniques to enhance the data and extract useful insights:
- Recategorization of variables based on domain knowledge
- Transformation of continuous variables into categorical ones
- Simplification of complex datasets for easier analysis and visualization

## Analysis and Visualizations

This section includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to understand patterns in the data:
- Bar charts
- Pie charts
- Histograms
- Box plots

## Conclusions and Next Steps

In this project, we simplified the data by grouping and categorizing variables. The next steps include applying machine learning models to predict outcomes based on the preprocessed data.
